# Chinchillas, chinchillas, chinchillas!

This repository contains source files for all my Chinchilla designs used across merchandise, presentations and my website.

Feel free to use them and change them as much as you like as long as you acknowledge the source.

**Note**: This repository uses [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to manage the larger files.

The SVGs are likely not optimised as they are pure exports from Illustrator right now, I will tweak this over term.

More to follow...
